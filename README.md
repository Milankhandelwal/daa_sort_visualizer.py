# 🔍 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer (DAA Project)

This project visualizes the step-by-step working of two popular sorting algorithms: **Bubble Sort** and **Quick Sort**. It is built as part of a Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) project.

## 📽️ What It Does

- Animates the sorting process using `matplotlib`.
- Shows the array as vertical bars.
- Displays iteration count live.
- Demonstrates the differences between brute-force and divide-and-conquer strategies.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

### 1. Bubble Sort
- Brute Force Approach
- Time Complexity: O(n²)
- Easy to understand and visualize

### 2. Quick Sort
- Divide and Conquer Approach
- Time Complexity: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case
- Fast and efficient
